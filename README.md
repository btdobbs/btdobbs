- 👋 Hi, my name is Todd Dobbs.
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching computer science and researching topics where art and computer science intersect.  I am also interested in the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computer science.
- 🌱 I will graduate with my PhD in Computer Science at UNCC in December 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with artists, astronomers, and mathematicians.
- 📫 I can be reached at btdobbs@uncc.edu.
