- 👋 Hi, my name is Todd Dobbs.
- 👀 I am interested in teaching software engineering, database systems, and the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computer science.  I am also interested in teaching computer science and researching topics where art and computer science intersect.  
- 🌱 I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science at UNCC in December 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with artists, astronomers, mathematicians, software engineers, and database designers on research projects.
- 📫 I can be reached at btdobbs@charlotte.edu.
